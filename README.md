# POLARIS v5 — install & operate

Drop-in parallel-agent operating system for any repo. Any model/CLI that loads a repo instruction file runs it; under Claude Code the shipped `.claude/` folder adds a project **skill** (sessions auto-discover the protocol) and a **PreToolUse write-guard**. `CLAUDE.md` stays a thin router on purpose — adherence drops on long instruction files.

New in v5, the guard and the gates enforce **two** things: ownership (diff ⊆ `files_owned`, unchanged since v3) and **RULES** — your repo's policy as data. One TAB-separated line in `ops/RULES.tsv` is a danger zone (`path`: forbidden to write, even inside owned files) or a content guard (`content`: added lines must not match an ERE). INIT turns your "never touch X" interview answers into armed rules instead of prose; EVOLVE proposes new lines from kickback/Learned evidence and a human approves each one. That is "hooks that create themselves" done safely: evidence → proposal → approve → one appended line, zero new scripts.

## Install (any repo, greenfield or 10k files)
**One file. One command.** `polaris-v5.zip` is the whole kit, carries no `.git`, and is a Python **zipapp** — so there is no unzip step:

```bash
cd your-project
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/oscarsolis3301/POLARIS/releases/latest/download/polaris-v5.zip
python polaris-v5.zip
```

**Or let Claude do it.** Once per machine:

```bash
python polaris-v5.zip --claude-skill
```

From then on, in **any** repo, just say **"install POLARIS"** — and it installs, **offline and without a single permission prompt**. You never download or drag anything again.

That one command writes three things to `~/.claude/`, and it needs all three. The **skill** teaches Claude the procedure. The **kit** is cached beside it, so installing is a local file copy instead of a download. And a few **Bash permission rules** are appended to `permissions.allow` in your `settings.json`, so the commands are pre-authorized.

Why the rules matter: Claude Code refuses to fetch code from a source you never named and execute it — so a skill that has to `curl` the kit first gets **denied in every fresh repo**, which reads as a broken installer when it is really a blocked one. A rule in your own settings *is* you naming the source (the URL is pinned in full, never a wildcard). Existing settings are preserved — rules are appended only if absent, the file is written via a temp file so an interrupted run cannot truncate it, and a `settings.json` that can't be parsed is left alone and the rules printed for you to paste. Don't want it touched at all? `--claude-skill --no-permissions`.

The cached kit doesn't auto-refresh — it's whatever zip last ran `--claude-skill`. Re-run it from a newer zip to update.

Greenfield folder with no `.git` yet? Name it and the installer runs `git init` for you: `python polaris-v5.zip <target-repo>`. Standing in a directory that isn't a repo, with no target named, it **refuses** — otherwise running it on your Desktop would turn the Desktop into a git repo.

The install is safe on a 10k-file project. An existing `CLAUDE.md` is **prepended to**, never overwritten. An existing `.claude/settings.json` has the guard hook **merged into** its hooks block, leaving your own hooks intact. A live board keeps its board, `RULES.tsv`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, `MAP.md` and `SPRINT.md` — only kit code is refreshed (then `bash ops/polaris upgrade`). Nothing is committed for you. Idempotent — safe to re-run.

Then **start a new session** (CLAUDE.md and the hook are read at session start) and say: **"You are INIT."**

*No Python?* The kit itself doesn't need it — only this bootstrap and the dashboard do. Fall back to `unzip polaris-v5.zip && bash polaris-v5/ops/install.sh`.
*Windows:* use Git Bash, or run the zipapp straight from PowerShell — it finds Git Bash itself. (It deliberately ignores `System32\bash.exe`, which is WSL, not a shell POLARIS can use.)

**From a clone.** `bash ops/install.sh <target-repo>` from the kit root does the same thing. Or by hand:
1. Copy `CLAUDE.md` + `ops/` + `.claude/` into the repo root. `chmod +x ops/polaris ops/hooks/ownership-guard.sh`.
   - Repo already has a `CLAUDE.md`? Paste the POLARIS content at the TOP (constraints early = better adherence).
   - Repo already has `.claude/settings.json`? Merge the `hooks` block instead of overwriting.
   - Upgrading a live v3 or v4 board? Copy the kit files over, then `bash ops/polaris upgrade` (idempotent; board, tasks and locks untouched — v5 adds no task frontmatter fields, so there is zero task migration).
2. Commit. Open a session: **"You are INIT."** It runs `doctor` (+ `--selftest` on a machine's first use), surveys within a hard read budget, interviews you (~10 questions), writes `ops/MAP.md` / `CONVENTIONS.md` / `SPRINT.md`, and arms `ops/RULES.tsv` from your danger-zone answers.
3. Claude Code will ask to trust the project hook on first use — that's the write-guard; approving it is expected. (Read it first: `ops/hooks/ownership-guard.sh`, ~100 lines.)

## The loop (every sprint) — kickoffs in `ops/PROMPTS.md`
1. **Plan** — 1 session: PLANNER reads `metrics` (per-point calibration) + `drift`, runs a pre-mortem against the Learned log, then grooms your idea into contract-backed, file-disjoint tasks.
2. **Fan out** — `bash ops/polaris fleet N` (or N terminals with the identical Builder kickoff).
3. **Watch** — `bash ops/polaris dash` → **http://127.0.0.1:7373**: constellation task graph, six columns, ticking lock ages, **points strip**, **drift rail**, metrics, Learned log — plus an opt-in 🔔 that fires a browser notification the moment any task changes column. Read-only, SSE, stdlib-only Python.
4. **Integrate** — 1 session: INTEGRATOR audits (ownership + rules), batch-merges, runs the suite once, runs your optional `uat:` command once, lands, sweeps, runs `drift`, promotes.
5. **Evolve** (optional, between sprints) — EVOLVE reads `metrics`/`drift`/`rules` + Learned and proposes ≤3 evidence-backed amendments — including new RULES lines; nothing applies without your "approve".

## Why it can't conflict
The Planner assigns every task a disjoint `files_owned` set — and v5 makes that invariant **machine-checkable**: `ops/polaris drift` cross-tests every pattern pair across `ready/ ∪ active/` (identical · exact⊂glob · exact⊂dir/ · dir/⊂dir/ are proven; non-identical glob∩glob is undecidable, which is why the Planner rule says keep globs narrow). Enforcement of ownership + rules is three-deep: the write-guard blocks at the keystroke (Claude Code), `polaris verify`/`handoff` proves it on the diff (ANY model or CLI), and `polaris audit` re-proves it before merge (optionally in CI — `ops/ci/polaris-audit.yml`, which can also gate on `drift --strict`). The only runtime race — two Builders grabbing one task — is broken by an atomic lock, or a claim-branch push for multi-machine setups.

## Points, calibrated
Every `claim` and `done` telemetry line now carries the task's points, so `polaris metrics` reports cycle-p50 **per point bucket** — "your 3-pointers actually take 9h" is the sentence that fixes pointing. The Planner reads it before every sprint; EVOLVE watches it across sprints; the dashboard shows ready/WIP points at a glance.

## Pick how agents talk to you
`voice: standard | technical` in `ops/CONVENTIONS.md`. **`standard`** (the default) is plain, friendly English — a teammate explaining what they did. **`technical`** is dense and terse, what every POLARIS agent sounded like before v5.2. INIT asks this **first, alone, before its interview**, then asks the interview itself in your voice: you are never made to choose between `paranoid` and `batch` before you've read a word of the docs — you're asked whether to re-run the tests after every merge or once at the end, and INIT maps the answer to the config.

It changes **what agents say**, never what they do. Reports, questions and `✅`/`⛔` lines follow it; task files, contracts, `MAP.md`, `RULES.tsv`, commit messages and code stay machine-terse, because agents read those. And a friendlier voice is not a quieter one — a red suite is still reported red, and no gate softens.

## Optional per-repo keys (CONVENTIONS.md)
`uat: <cmd>` — an end-to-end suite the Integrator runs ONCE on the integrate branch (red bisects exactly like a red unit suite). `notify: <cmd>` — runs in the background on every board event with `POLARIS_EV`/`POLARIS_ID`/`POLARIS_NOTE` env vars; wire it to ntfy, Slack, `osascript`, anything — it can observe the board but can never stall or fail it. Both are slots, not dependencies: POLARIS stays language-agnostic and ships neither.

## Dependencies — still deliberately near-zero
git ≥ 2.5 + bash (+ your test runner). The dashboard needs a stock **Python 3.8+, stdlib only — no pip, no node, no build step**. Windows: **Git Bash**. The moat is the protocol, not tooling.

## Verified / unverified — this build
Verified by execution: v5 selftest end-to-end (8-way claim race → 1 winner · ownership accept/reject · verify commands · handoff · done cleanup · claim/done events **with points** · per-point metrics buckets · `_match` · RULES path deny overriding ownership · RULES content deny on payload AND on the committed diff · drift catching a seeded ownership overlap · `drift --strict` exit code) · guard scenario matrix incl. rules-vs-owned-file, content block from Write/Edit/MultiEdit payloads, fail-open without python, non-POLARIS-repo stand-down · full lifecycle telemetry + metrics math · two-clone EVENTS union-merge (zero conflicts) · dashboard `/state` v5 contract (pts · drift · rules_n), SSE push-on-change, drift rail + points strip + bell markers, extracted script passes `node --check` · notify: fires per event, a failing notify command cannot break a claim · `upgrade` on a live v4 board is purely additive and idempotent · virgin install of this zip passes `doctor --selftest` and boots the dashboard.
**Verified in CI on every push — Linux, macOS and Windows** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): the archive keeps its exec bits (checked against the mode *stored in the zip*, because Windows has no exec bit and Git Bash fakes `test -x`) · no CRLF · it is a valid zipapp · drag-and-run installs non-destructively over a repo that already has its own `CLAUDE.md` and its own `PreToolUse` hook · `doctor --selftest` passes · **and the macOS job re-runs the whole drill under an explicit `/bin/bash` 3.2**, since GitHub's image puts a newer Homebrew bash first on `PATH` and a bare `bash` would silently test bash 5 and prove nothing · `uninstall` returns the repo to its original state.

Unverified, on purpose (test on YOUR machines — that's what `doctor --selftest` is for): browser-notification permission UX varies per browser · `ops/ci/polaris-audit.yml`, the audit gate template you copy into *your* repo (its logic is the same `polaris audit` verified locally and in CI; the wrapper's first run in your repo is its test).
Verified on Windows 11 + Git for Windows 2.53 (2026-07-11), after two fixes this repo carries: `doctor --selftest` green · dashboard boots (python detection no longer fooled by the Windows Store `python3` stub) · 8-scenario guard matrix green with backslash AND forward-slash tool paths (guard now norm()s git-reported toplevel/worktree paths, which Git prints as `C:/...`) · the shipped hook command runs verbatim under Git Bash — the shell Claude Code uses for hooks on Windows.

## v4 → v5
- **`ops/RULES.tsv` policy engine** — danger zones + content guards as data, enforced three-deep (write-guard → verify/handoff → audit). Deny-only by design: on PreToolUse, exit-0 stdout is debug-log-only, so an "advisory" the model can't see must not exist.
- **`polaris drift [--strict]`** — the board's invariants, machine-checked: files_owned overlap across ready∪active, ready-gate (contract exists, deps done, ≤5pts), branch cruft, stale `TODO(task)` refs, MAP/Learned overflow, telemetry safety. CI-able.
- **Per-point calibration** — points ride the claim/done telemetry; `metrics` prints cycle-p50 per bucket; PLANNER §read + EVOLVE consume it.
- **Planner pre-mortem + wired-controls guardrail** · **Integrator `uat:` gate** · **`notify:` event hook** · **dashboard**: points strip, drift rail, rules count, opt-in browser notifications.
- **Write routing table** (CONVENTIONS skeleton): one fact, one home, one writer — the drift class where two files disagree about the same fact can't start.
- Unchanged and untouched: v3/v4's race-tested claim/lock/worktree/merge mechanics, all invariants, task format (**zero migration**).

## Removing it
`bash ops/polaris uninstall --yes` — deletes `ops/`, the managed `CLAUDE.md` block, the guard hook and the POLARIS gitignore lines. **Keeps your own `CLAUDE.md` content and your other hooks.** It refuses while any task sits in `active/` or `review/` (that's unfinished work), commits nothing, and `git checkout -- .` is the undo. Verified in CI: a repo that had its own `CLAUDE.md` and its own `PreToolUse` hook comes back byte-identical.

## Versions and updates
`ops/polaris version` prints what this repo runs — version, commit, build date — and what the latest is on the channel. `ops/VERSION` names that channel (raw `ops/VERSION` on `main` in this public repo), so the check is one unauthenticated `curl`: no token, no `gh`, no credentials.

The check hits the network **at most once a day**; the notice prints on **every** command until you act on it, so an update can't slip past you. It fails open — offline, no `curl`, or a junk response and it stays silent — and it never runs inside the write-guard, which fires on every edit.

Nothing ever updates itself. `ops/polaris update` is explicit: it fetches the latest kit, refreshes **kit code only** (board, RULES, CONVENTIONS, MAP, SPRINT untouched), runs `upgrade`, and leaves the diff uncommitted for you to review. It refuses on a dirty worktree. POLARIS will not rewrite `ops/polaris` or the guard out from under a builder mid-sprint.

Only a deliberate `version:` bump notifies installed kits — routine commits to `main` don't nag anyone.

## Releasing the kit (maintainer)
`python ops/pack.py` builds `polaris-v5.zip` from `git ls-files`. It's Python because Git Bash ships no `zip` and PowerShell's `Compress-Archive` can't store unix permissions — three kit files are mode `100755`, and an archive that drops the exec bit delivers a kit that's dead on arrival. It also normalises to LF, so an `autocrlf=true` checkout can't poison the archive, and it refuses to build from a dirty worktree so the zip always maps to a real commit.

To cut a release: `python ops/pack.py --bump minor` → update `CHANGELOG.md` → commit → `git tag v5.1.0 && git push --tags`. CI builds the zip, asserts the exec bits and LF survived, and attaches it to the Release. `ops/polaris doctor` warns whenever the local zip lags `HEAD` — that's the rot that left the previous zip shipping pre-CRLF-fix code.

## Safety note
These prompts drive agents with real filesystem and git access. Keep the stop-and-ask list in `CLAUDE.md` intact when customizing. Deliberately NOT included, and why: agents never auto-install dependencies (supply-chain risk — the stop-and-ask gate stays), agents never edit `ops/RULES.tsv` (append is human-only; EVOLVE proposes), and `notify:`/`uat:` run with your user's permissions like any `verify:` command — treat CONVENTIONS.md as executable config. The hook runs with your user's permissions — read it before approving. The dashboard is read-only and binds localhost; `--host 0.0.0.0` exposes board text to your network.
